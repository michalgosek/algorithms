# Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree is a tree is unidirected graph which staisfies any of
following defiintions:

1. An acylic connected graph
2. A connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges
3. A graph in which any two vertices are connected 
by exactly one path

**Example of usage**:
* Implementation of some map and set ADTs
* Red Black Trees
* AVL Trees
* Splay Trees 
* Used in the implementation of binary heaps
* Syntax tree (used by compiler and calculators)
* Treap - a probabilistic DS (uses a radnomized BST)

Space and Time complexity: 

| Operation | AVG | Worst |
| :---     |    :----:    |   ---: |
| Insert   | O(log(n))    | O(n)   |
| Delele   | O(log(n))    | O(n)   |
| Remove   | O(log(n))    | O(n)   |
| Search   | O(log(n))    | O(n)   |
